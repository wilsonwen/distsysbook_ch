<a name="index_ch"></a><h2 id="-">简介</h2>
<p>我一直想要一本书，能够汇集最近一些流行的分布式系统(如亚马逊的Dynamo，谷歌的BigTable和MapReduce, Apache的Hadoop)的理论。</p>
<p>在这本书里，我尝试提供一个更容易理解的分布式系统导论。这分两个方面：介绍一些重要概念，然后你<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=super+cool+ski+instructor">有更多时间</a>可以阅读更多的专业文章；同时通过足够细致的叙述，使你能够明白分布式的要点，而不纠缠于细枝末节。现在已经是2013年了，你可以通过互联网，选择性的阅读更多你感兴趣的内容。</p>
<p>在我看来，很多分布式程序设计是关于处理分布式的两种后果的影响：</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>信息以光速传播</li>
<li>各部分独立地失效</li>
</ul>
<p>换句话说，分布式程序设计的核心是处理距离（废话）。这些约束定义了系统设计的空间，我希望在读完这本书以后，你会对距离、时间和一致性模型的交互有更好的理解。</p>
<p>这本书聚焦于分布式程序设计和理解数据中心的商业系统所需的系统概念。如果尝试涉及所有内容，我会疯的。你将会学习到关键的协议和算法（例如，这个学科里最常被引用的论文），包括一些新的令人兴奋的方式去看待“最终一致性”，比如CRDTS和CALM定理，这些甚至在高校教科书里都还没有。</p>
<p>我希望你能够喜欢这本书！如果你想感谢我，可以关注我<a href="https://github.com/mixu/">Github</a>(或者<a href="http://twitter.com/mikitotakada">Twitter</a>)。如果你发现了错误，可以<a href="https://github.com/mixu/distsysbook/issues">在Github上pull request</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>分布式程序设计是在多台计算机上解决问题的艺术。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>任何计算机系统都需要完成两个基本的任务</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>存储</li>
<li>计算</li>
</ul>
<p>分布式程序设计是在多台计算机上解决问题的艺术。通常来说，是因为这个问题单机无法解决。</p>
<p>没有人要求你必须使用分布式系统。如果有无限的金钱和无限的研发时间，我们就不需要分布式系统。所有的计算和存储都可以在一个神奇的盒子上完成，一个超级迅速和超级可靠的系统。</p>
<p>但是，很少人有无限的资源。所以，他们要找到现实世界中，找到花销与收益的平衡点。在小规模下，升级硬件是一个可行的策略。不过，随着问题体积变大，你会达到硬件更新无法在单节点下解决问题的临界点。在这种情况下，我热烈欢迎你来到分布式系统的世界。</p>
<p>现在的现实是，最有价值的是中档的商用硬件设备，只要其维护费用可以通过容错软件来降低。</p>
<p>计算主要受益于可以以内存访问替代网络访问的高端硬件。而高端硬件的性能会受限于需要节点间大量通信的任务。</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="images/barroso_holzle.png" alt="cost-efficiency"></p>
<p>正如上图所示<a href="http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00516ED2V01Y201306CAC024">Barroso, Clidaras &amp; Holzle</a>,在统一内存访问的模型下，高端硬件与普通硬件的性能差别随着集群的规模降低。</p>
<p>理想情况下，添加一台机器可以线性的提升系统的性能和容量。不过这当然是不可能的，因为会有额外的开销。数据需要复制多次，计算任务需要协同工作等。这就是学习分布式算法的原因———分布式算法针对特定问题提供了有效的解决方法，同时明确了什么是可能发生的，正确的实现的最小开销是多少和什么是不可能发生的。</p>
<p>本书的重点在于传统的但商业相关的分布式程序设计和分布式系统：数据中心。例如，我不会讨论奇怪的网络设置或者共享内存设置里的问题。另外，我们的重点在与探讨系统的设计空间，而不是优化任何特定的设计，后者是一个更加专业的话题。</p>
<h2 id="-">我们的目的：可扩展性和其他好处</h2>
<p>我看待问题的方法，所有事情都需要考虑规模。</p>
<p>大多是事情在小规模时都是微不足道的。但是一旦你超过一定的规模、浏览或其他物理限制时，问题就变得困难。拿起一块巧克力很简单，但是拿起一座山就很难。统计一间房间里的人数很简单，统计一个国家的人数就很难。</p>
<p>所以任何事情都伴随着规模 —— 可扩展性。非正式的说，在一个可扩展系统里，我们从小规模到大规模，事情不应该逐渐的恶化。下面是另一个定义：</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/可扩展性">可扩展性</a></dt>
  <dd>是系统，网络或进程能够在处理能力范围内处理不断增长的任务的能力，或者是能够扩展适应增长的能力。</dd>
</dl>

<p>不断增长的是什么？你几乎可以从任何角度来衡量增长（人口数量，电力使用等等）。但是，有三个有趣的事情：</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Size scalability: adding more nodes should make the system linearly faster; growing the dataset should not increase latency</li>
<li>Geographic scalability: it should be possible to use multiple data centers to reduce the time it takes to respond to user queries, while dealing with cross-data center latency in some sensible manner.</li>
<li>Administrative scalability: adding more nodes should not increase the administrative costs of the system (e.g. the administrators-to-machines ratio).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, in a real system growth occurs on multiple different axes simultaneously; each metric captures just some aspect of growth.</p>
<p>A scalable system is one that continues to meet the needs of its users as scale increases. There are two particularly relevant aspects - performance and availability - which can be measured in various ways.</p>
<h3 id="performance-and-latency-">Performance (and latency)</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_performance">Performance</a></dt>
  <dd>is characterized by the amount of useful work accomplished by a computer system compared to the time and resources used.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Depending on the context, this may involve achieving one or more of the following:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Short response time/low latency for a given piece of work</li>
<li>High throughput (rate of processing work)</li>
<li>Low utilization of computing resource(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are tradeoffs involved in optimizing for any of these outcomes. For example, a system may achieve a higher throughput by processing larger batches of work thereby reducing operation overhead. The tradeoff would be longer response times for individual pieces of work due to batching.</p>
<p>I find that low latency - achieving a short response time - is the most interesting aspect of performance, because it has a strong connection with physical (rather than financial) limitations. It is harder to address latency using financial resources than the other aspects of performance.</p>
<p>There are a lot of really specific definitions for latency, but I really like the idea that the etymology of the word evokes:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Latency</dt>
  <dd>The state of being latent; delay, a period between the initiation of something and the occurrence.</dd>
</dl>

<p>And what does it mean to be &quot;latent&quot;?</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Latent</dt>
  <dd>From Latin latens, latentis, present participle of lateo (&quot;lie hidden&quot;). Existing or present but concealed or inactive.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This definition is pretty cool, because it highlights how latency is really the time between something happened and the time it has an impact or becomes visible.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that you are infected with an airborne virus that turns people into zombies. The latent period is the time between when you became infected, and when you turn into a zombie. That&#39;s latency: the time during which something that has already happened is concealed from view.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s assume for a moment that our distributed system does just one high-level task: given a query, it takes all of the data in the system and calculates a single result. In other words, think of a distributed system as a data store with the ability to run a single deterministic computation (function) over its current content:</p>
<p><code>result = query(all data in the system)</code></p>
<p>Then, what matters for latency is not the amount of old data, but rather the speed at which new data &quot;takes effect&quot; in the system. For example, latency could be measured in terms of how long it takes for a write to become visible to readers.</p>
<p>The other key point based on this definition is that if nothing happens, there is no &quot;latent period&quot;. A system in which data doesn&#39;t change doesn&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t) have a latency problem.</p>
<p>In a distributed system, there is a minimum latency that cannot be overcome: the speed of light limits how fast information can travel, and hardware components have a minimum latency cost incurred per operation (think RAM and hard drives but also CPUs).</p>
<p>How much that minimum latency impacts your queries depends on the nature of those queries and the physical distance the information needs to travel.</p>
<h3 id="availability-and-fault-tolerance-">Availability (and fault tolerance)</h3>
<p>The second aspect of a scalable system is availability.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability">Availability</a></dt>
  <dd>the proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition. If a user cannot access the system, it is said to be unavailable. </dd>
</dl>

<p>Distributed systems allow us to achieve desirable characteristics that would be hard to accomplish on a single system. For example, a single machine cannot tolerate any failures since it either fails or doesn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Distributed systems can take a bunch of unreliable components, and build a reliable system on top of them.</p>
<p>Systems that have no redundancy can only be as available as their underlying components. Systems built with redundancy can be tolerant of partial failures and thus be more available. It is worth noting that &quot;redundant&quot; can mean different things depending on what you look at - components, servers, datacenters and so on.</p>
<p>Formulaically, availability is: <code>Availability = uptime / (uptime + downtime)</code>.</p>
<p>Availability from a technical perspective is mostly about being fault tolerant. Because the probability of a failure occurring increases with the number of components, the system should be able to compensate so as to not become less reliable as the number of components increases.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td>Availability %</td>
  <td>How much downtime is allowed per year?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>90% (&quot;one nine&quot;)</td>
  <td>More than a month</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>99% (&quot;two nines&quot;)</td>
  <td>Less than 4 days</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>99.9% (&quot;three nines&quot;)</td>
  <td>Less than 9 hours</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>99.99% (&quot;four nines&quot;)</td>
  <td>Less than an hour</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>99.999% (&quot;five nines&quot;)</td>
  <td>~ 5 minutes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>99.9999% (&quot;six nines&quot;)</td>
  <td>~ 31 seconds</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>Availability is in some sense a much wider concept than uptime, since the availability of a service can also be affected by, say, a network outage or the company owning the service going out of business (which would be a factor which is not really relevant to fault tolerance but would still influence the availability of the system). But without knowing every single specific aspect of the system, the best we can do is design for fault tolerance.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be fault tolerant?</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Fault tolerance</dt>
  <dd>ability of a system to behave in a well-defined manner once faults occur</dd>
</dl>

<p>Fault tolerance boils down to this: define what faults you expect and then design a system or an algorithm that is tolerant of them. You can&#39;t tolerate faults you haven&#39;t considered.</p>
<h2 id="what-prevents-us-from-achieving-good-things-">What prevents us from achieving good things?</h2>
<p>Distributed systems are constrained by two physical factors:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>the number of nodes (which increases with the required storage and computation capacity)</li>
<li>the distance between nodes (information travels, at best, at the speed of light)</li>
</ul>
<p>Working within those constraints:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>an increase in the number of independent nodes increases the probability of failure in a system (reducing availability and increasing administrative costs)</li>
<li>an increase in the number of independent nodes may increase the need for communication between nodes (reducing performance as scale increases)</li>
<li>an increase in geographic distance increases the minimum latency for communication between distant nodes (reducing performance for certain operations)</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these tendencies - which are a result of the physical constraints - is the world of system design options.</p>
<p>Both performance and availability are defined by the external guarantees the system makes. On a high level, you can think of the guarantees as the SLA (service level agreement) for the system: if I write data, how quickly can I access it elsewhere? After the data is written, what guarantees do I have of durability? If I ask the system to run a computation, how quickly will it return results? When components fail, or are taken out of operation, what impact will this have on the system?</p>
<p>There is another criterion, which is not explicitly mentioned but implied: intelligibility. How understandable are the guarantees that are made? Of course, there are no simple metrics for what is intelligible.</p>
<p>I was kind of tempted to put &quot;intelligibility&quot; under physical limitations. After all, it is a hardware limitation in people that we have a hard time understanding anything that involves <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory#Capacity">more moving things than we have fingers</a>. That&#39;s the difference between an error and an anomaly - an error is incorrect behavior, while an anomaly is unexpected behavior. If you were smarter, you&#39;d expect the anomalies to occur.</p>
<h2 id="abstractions-and-models">Abstractions and models</h2>
<p>This is where abstractions and models come into play. Abstractions make things more manageable by removing real-world aspects that are not relevant to solving a problem. Models describe the key properties of a distributed system in a precise manner. I&#39;ll discuss many kinds of models in the next chapter, such as:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>System model (asynchronous / synchronous)</li>
<li>Failure model (crash-fail, partitions, Byzantine)</li>
<li>Consistency model (strong, eventual)</li>
</ul>
<p>A good abstraction makes working with a system easier to understand, while capturing the factors that are relevant for a particular purpose.</p>
<p>There is a tension between the reality that there are many nodes and with our desire for systems that &quot;work like a single system&quot;. Often, the most familiar model (for example, implementing a shared memory abstraction on a distributed system) is too expensive.</p>
<p>A system that makes weaker guarantees has more freedom of action, and hence potentially greater performance - but it is also potentially hard to reason about. People are better at reasoning about systems that work like a single system, rather than a collection of nodes.</p>
<p>One can often gain performance by exposing more details about the internals of the system. For example, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS">columnar storage</a>, the user can (to some extent) reason about the locality of the key-value pairs within the system and hence make decisions that influence the performance of typical queries. Systems which hide these kinds of details are easier to understand (since they act more like single unit, with fewer details to think about), while systems that expose more real-world details may be more performant (because they correspond more closely to reality).</p>
<p>Several types of failures make writing distributed systems that act like a single system difficult. Network latency and network partitions (e.g. total network failure between some nodes) mean that a system needs to sometimes make hard choices about whether it is better to stay available but lose some crucial guarantees that cannot be enforced, or to play it safe and refuse clients when these types of failures occur.</p>
<p>The CAP theorem - which I will discuss in the next chapter - captures some of these tensions. In the end, the ideal system meets both programmer needs (clean semantics) and business needs (availability/consistency/latency).</p>
<h2 id="design-techniques-partition-and-replicate">Design techniques: partition and replicate</h2>
<p>The manner in which a data set is distributed between multiple nodes is very important. In order for any computation to happen, we need to locate the data and then act on it.</p>
<p>There are two basic techniques that can be applied to a data set. It can be split over multiple nodes (partitioning) to allow for more parallel processing. It can also be copied or cached on different nodes to reduce the distance between the client and the server and for greater fault tolerance (replication).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Divide and conquer - I mean, partition and replicate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The picture below illustrates the difference between these two: partitioned data (A and B below) is divided into independent sets, while replicated data (C below) is copied to multiple locations.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="images/part-repl.png" alt="Partition and replicate"></p>
<p>This is the one-two punch for solving any problem where distributed computing plays a role. Of course, the trick is in picking the right technique for your concrete implementation; there are many algorithms that implement replication and partitioning, each with different limitations and advantages which need to be assessed against your design objectives.</p>
<h3 id="partitioning">Partitioning</h3>
<p>Partitioning is dividing the dataset into smaller distinct independent sets; this is used to reduce the impact of dataset growth since each partition is a subset of the data.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Partitioning improves performance by limiting the amount of data to be examined and by locating related data in the same partition</li>
<li>Partitioning improves availability by allowing partitions to fail independently, increasing the number of nodes that need to fail before availability is sacrificed</li>
</ul>
<p>Partitioning is also very much application-specific, so it is hard to say much about it without knowing the specifics. That&#39;s why the focus is on replication in most texts, including this one.</p>
<p>Partitioning is mostly about defining your partitions based on what you think the primary access pattern will be, and dealing with the limitations that come from having independent partitions (e.g. inefficient access across partitions, different rate of growth etc.).</p>
<h3 id="replication">Replication</h3>
<p>Replication is making copies of the same data on multiple machines; this allows more servers to take part in the computation.</p>
<p>Let me inaccurately quote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_vs._the_Eighteenth_Amendment">Homer J. Simpson</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To replication! The cause of, and solution to all of life&#39;s problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Replication - copying or reproducing something - is the primary way in which we can fight latency.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Replication improves performance by making additional computing power and bandwidth applicable to a new copy of the data</li>
<li>Replication improves availability by creating additional copies of the data, increasing the number of nodes that need to fail before availability is sacrificed</li>
</ul>
<p>Replication is about providing extra bandwidth, and caching where it counts. It is also about maintaining consistency in some way according to some consistency model.</p>
<p>Replication allows us to achieve scalability, performance and fault tolerance. Afraid of loss of availability or reduced performance? Replicate the data to avoid a bottleneck or single point of failure. Slow computation? Replicate the computation on multiple systems. Slow I/O? Replicate the data to a local cache to reduce latency or onto multiple machines to increase throughput.</p>
<p>Replication is also the source of many of the problems, since there are now independent copies of the data that has to be kept in sync on multiple machines - this means ensuring that the replication follows a consistency model.</p>
<p>The choice of a consistency model is crucial: a good consistency model provides clean semantics for programmers (in other words, the properties it guarantees are easy to reason about) and meets business/design goals such as high availability or strong consistency.</p>
<p>Only one consistency model for replication - strong consistency - allows you to program as-if the underlying data was not replicated. Other consistency models expose some internals of the replication to the programmer. However, weaker consistency models can provide lower latency and higher availability - and are not necessarily harder to understand, just different.</p>
